# IFEMS
An Infinite Flight Event Management System

---

## Installation
1. Go to the releases and download your desired version. Standard is for single route events (ie all pilots fly the same route from one airport to another) and flyout is, well, for flyouts. I am not able to make custom versions at this time.
2. Create a MySQL Database called `ems` from your cPanel
3. Upload all files contained in the release download
4. Run the SQL Script contained in the release download.
5. Go into `mysql.php` and set the fill out your database details as appropriate.

## Server Requirements
* MySQL and MySQLi PHP Extension

## This Branch
Contained in this branch is the **standard** version of IFEMS. Do not download directly from this branch, it is likely unstable. Instead, use the releases page and select the standard version.
